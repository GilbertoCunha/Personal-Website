			I am a Physics Engineer, graduated from University of Minho.

			From very early in my academic path, the field of Data Science has been my primary interest. I have made multiple Data Science projects,
			which you can find on my <a href="https://github.com/GilbertoCunha">Github profile</a>.

			<br>

			I consider myself a very good problem solver and critical thinker, which I believe is mostly due to my Physics background. It allows me to 
			quickly tackle new problems or learn new skills.

			<br>

			On a more personal note, I love playing guitar, watching Formula 1 or reading Berserk.
